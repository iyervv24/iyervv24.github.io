        <h2>About — bridging strategy and execution</h2>
        <p>I’m an enterprise IT and business-transformation leader with 35+ years of hands-on experience delivering ERP, warehouse automation, and operational programs that move the needle. I partner with executive teams to make technology investments measurable, low-risk, and fast-paying-back.</p>

        <h3>How I help leadership teams</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Outcome-first pilots:</strong> small, practical pilots with measurable KPIs to prove value before scale.</li>
          <li><strong>Governance that prevents rework:</strong> vendor/board-ready reporting, acceptance criteria, and rapid remediation loops.</li>
          <li><strong>Operational adoption:</strong> training + process tweaks that make new systems stick in daily operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Representative results</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SAP ECC rollouts:</strong> delivered multi-country implementations with minimal business disruption.</li>
          <li><strong>RFID program:</strong> raised inventory accuracy to <strong>97%</strong> for a national client through combined process + tech changes.</li>
          <li><strong>Barcode & logistics:</strong> reduced shortages, damages and mis-picks at an overseas ceramics manufacturer by improving labeling, receiving and cycle counts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top:14px;">I’m direct, calm, and collaborative — described by peers as intellectually sharp, approachable, and relentless on execution. If your board wants measurable outcomes from IT investments, I get that done.</p>
